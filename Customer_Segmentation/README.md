# 🧠 Customer Segmentation — Machine Learning Project

A complete end-to-end Machine Learning project where I perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The goal is to identify different customer groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. This helps businesses improve marketing strategy, personalization, and decision-making.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses **unsupervised learning** to segment customers into meaningful groups. The insights derived from this segmentation can help businesses target marketing campaigns, improve customer retention, and make data-driven business decisions.

The notebook includes:

- Data loading and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Data scaling  
- Clustering using **KMeans**  
- Finding optimal clusters using **Elbow Method** & **Silhouette Score**  
- Cluster visualization  
- Interpretation of customer segments

## 🧪 Machine Learning Techniques

- **KMeans Clustering**  
- **StandardScaler** (Data Scaling)  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** (optional, for dimensionality reduction)  
- **Elbow Method** (to find the optimal number of clusters)  
- **Silhouette Score** (for cluster quality evaluation)
