# 💰 Loan Prediction App

## 📌 Overview
The **Loan Prediction App** is a Machine Learning–based web application that predicts the **loan amount a user can receive** based on their financial and personal details.  
The prediction is powered by a **Random Forest Regressor** model and deployed using **Streamlit** for a simple and interactive user experience.
