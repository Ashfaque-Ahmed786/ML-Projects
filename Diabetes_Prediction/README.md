# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Web App
### 🚀 Machine Learning | Logistic Regression | Streamlit

---

## 📌 Project Description
The **Diabetes Prediction Web App** is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts whether a person is at risk of diabetes based on medical attributes such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, and family history.

The project uses a **Logistic Regression model** trained on the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**, with proper data preprocessing and feature scaling. The trained model is saved using **Pickle** and deployed through an **interactive Streamlit web application**, allowing users to enter patient details and receive real-time predictions along with probability scores.

This project demonstrates the complete **Machine Learning workflow**, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment, making it suitable for **portfolio projects, learning purposes, and interviews**.
